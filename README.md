Acceptance test exercise

This assignment has two goals:  to set up your development environment and to have you learn how to write Python tests.  
The spreadsheet is is your statement of work.   As we discussed in class, you are playing the role of validator by 
determining if the statistical service requested by the customer is done, where "done" is defined by showing 
that the service passes tests designed to convey an acceptable level of confidence.   

The key parts of the spreadsheet are 1) a description of customer needs and 2) a place for you to document 
the results of acceptance tests.  The former is a description of the understanding between the customer and developer 
regarding what the software should do.  The latter is a place for you to document your tests by showing the intent of 
each test together with whether the test passed or failed.  (The spreadsheet has an example test provided for you.)  
A "done" project should -- in this case, at least -- pass all tests.  Tests that fail indicate aspects that are not 
complete, and, hence, signal that the project is not complete.   For this assignment, if you identify a test that 
fails, please indicate what defect you discovered (in other words, you should indicate what aspect of the service is 
not complete).

This repository contains code we started in class.

Please use Eclipse equipped with PyDev Python plugin.   Explanatory screencasts are available via Canvas.

Your deliverables include:
Upload your GitHub Classroom URL as a "Website URL" submission to Canvas.
Upload your spreadsheet with "Acceptance Tab" completed" as a "File Upload" to Canvas.
Push your PyDev project to GitHubClassroom.
